		<h2>Katie L. Johnson Wilson: Attucks 1938</h2>
		<p>School 4 was wonderful. Everybody was friendly. Right now…the smoking…the drinking. Oh, I won’t talk about now. Back then, you were very friendly. Everybody was close. You knew every house in the neighborhood. All my memories of School 4 are pleasant. It was a beautiful brick building. Parents really told children what to do and how to do it and they did it. We went to Mount Zion Baptist Church. We didn’t know anything but the right way. The family, everybody on Douglas Street and the whole neighborhood, everybody was friendly. We just did the correct thing. Remember God. The problems of today, I don’t recognize them.

You must remember in those days, schools were segregated. They didn’t allow Negro children to go to Shortridge and Tech High School. We had no high school to go to for years. My parents came from Kentucky and they didn’t have high schools down there. After the eighth grade, you were through. The United States was segregated. Then, some very wonderful lawyers and other people in Indianapolis worked day and night and struggled until the school board got the money together and built Crispus Attucks High School.* Children who had been out of school for years came back to Attucks and that was the beginning of education. They were 18 and 19 years old coming back to high school. They hadn’t been able to go before. They were delighted. When you have not been able to do anything, and then all at once you get to do everything--we were glad when daylight came, so we could go every morning. We had the best teachers, because they had stayed long enough to get not only Bachelor’s and Master’s Degrees but PhDs. We had the best teachers in the state, better than the white ones. We loved Crispus Attucks...</p>

		<h2>Charles Bonsett: Tech 1939</h2>
		<p>Here I am, right here. (Bonsett holds up his eighth grade graduation picture.) This is my brother. He was 18 months older, but he had a sickness as an infant, so we went through school together. Now, this boy came from a very poor family and he needed a job, so he asked for a letter of recommendation. The principal refused. His response was to set fire to the school. Instead of going to high school with the rest of us, he went to the Boys School at Plainfield. This one became a dentist. This one became a doctor and this one became a doctor. This was considered the genius of the class. Can you imagine anybody this size doing oil paints that were really first class? This was Depression era, but his parents had the money to give him everything he needed. This one was the tragedy in the family. He was given a bicycle on his sixteenth birthday and he got killed by a car. That’s about the extent of it.

In my parents’ time, they thought you were an adult at 16 and ready to go to work. My mother had no difficulty getting a job in an office. From the Knightstown Orphan Home, she learned shorthand and typing and was quite talented. Now, my dad was different. He was orphaned too, but he was reared on a farm in Clark County. Prior to World War II, Clark County was still back in the 19th century. When we would go down there, they didn’t have electricity or telephones. The transportation was horse and buggy. My father was one of the oldest of 15 or 16 children. He had a relative that owned a motion picture theater, so he learned how to be a projectionist. My earliest recollection is of being on one parent’s lap or the other’s while they were reading to us. I tell you, it was really a pleasant sensation. My dad was very influential as far as what I did. He was interested in electricity and the latest technology. As they made advances in radio, he would either take the old one down to the country for his people or give them to me. He encouraged me to learn about these things, play with them, yes, but take them apart and put them back together. Get the diagrams. Learn what they mean. Boy, he was really something. An individual’s best and most important teachers are his parents...</p>
